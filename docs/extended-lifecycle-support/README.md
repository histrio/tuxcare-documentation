# Extended Lifecycle Support

TuxCare's [Extended Lifecycle Support (ELS)](https://tuxcare.com/extended-lifecycle-support/) service provides security updates, system enhancement patches, and selected bug fixes for older versions of a variety of Linux distributions, including CentOS 6, Oracle Linux 6, CloudLinux 6, CentOS 7, CentOS 8, Ubuntu 16.04, and Ubuntu 18.04. These distributions have either reached their end of standard support from vendors or have reached End of Life (EOL).

Our ELS service is designed to provide solutions for organizations that are not yet ready to migrate to newer versions and that are seeking long-term stability for their out-of-date operating systems. The service coverage includes updates for the Linux kernel and a list of essential packages that are integral to server operations.

### Vulnerability coverage

TuxCare employs the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS v3) to assess the severity of security vulnerabilities. Our severity rating system for patching vulnerabilities integrates both NVD scoring and vendor scoring (when available). When the vendor's score is lower than the NVD score, we give priority to the NVD score.

TuxCare Extended Lifecycle Support, by default, provides security patches for High and Critical vulnerabilities (with a 7+ CVSS score). For vulnerabilities rated as Medium (4.0 to 6.9), and/or when patches are required for FIPS-certified deployments, custom coverage options are available. Specific details regarding these coverage options and their pricing can be obtained by contacting our sales team.

### Target response times

Aligning with many industry standards and regulatory requirements, TuxCare is committed to delivering timely security updates. For instance, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) mandates that all 'High' vulnerabilities (CVSS score of 7.0+) must be addressed within 30 days. Other regulations and standards, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) for healthcare or the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) for government agencies, uphold similar requirements.

We aim to deliver security patches for critical and high-risk vulnerabilities (CVSS 7+) within 14 days from when the vulnerabilities become publicly disclosed. This rapid response time significantly reduces the window of opportunity for potential attackers and meets most security regulation requirements.

### Duration of support

TuxCare provides Extended Lifecycle Support (ELS) for up to four years (except for CentOS 7 which is supported for up to five years). This support is offered after the Linux distribution has reached its End of Life (EOL) or no longer receives standard support.

| **Distribution** | **EOL**  | **ELS**  |
|---|---|---|
| CentOS 6  | November 2020  | November 2026  |
| CentOS 7  | June 2024  | June 2029  |
| CentOS 8  | January 2022  | January 2026  |
| Oracle Linux 6  | December 2020  | December 2024  |
| Ubuntu 16.04  | April 2021  | April 2025  |
| Ubuntu 18.04  | April 2023  | April 2027  |

### Supported packages

TuxCare's Extended Lifecycle Support provides updates for a comprehensive list of packages integral to server operations (100+ packages), providing maximum security for your operating system. You can view the full list of supported packages for each operating system, as well as get detailed information on the patched Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), [here](https://cve.tuxcare.com/els/projects). Support for additional packages can be provided on request.

### Errata advisories

TuxCare Extended Lifecycle Support provides qualified security and selected bug-fix errata advisories across all architectures. They can help users track which CVEs are resolved and which bugs have been addressed. You can view the full list of released advisories [here](https://cve.tuxcare.com/els/releases).

### OVAL patch definitions

Leveraging the [Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL)](/extended-lifecycle-support/#oval-data) patch definitions with OVAL-compatible tools, e.g. OpenSCAP, users can accurately check their systems for the presence of vulnerabilities.

### Connection to ELS repository

## OVAL data

### Introduction

Identifying the vulnerabilities that apply to your systems is an important task for IT and InfoSec teams, and at TuxCare we make it easy. We provide OVAL data that contain instructions to the vulnerability scanner to determine the addressed vulnerabilities from the ELS updates.  This section contains information about available TuxCare ELS OVAL streams.

Currently, we provide OVAL data for the following products:

* CentOS 6 ELS
* Oracle Linux 6 ELS
* CentOS 7 ELS
* CentOS 8 ELS
* Ubuntu 16.04
* Ubuntu 18.04

### TuxCare ELS OVAL Streams

* CentOS 6: [https://repo.cloudlinux.com/centos6-els/centos6-els-oval.xml](https://repo.cloudlinux.com/centos6-els/centos6-els-oval.xml)
* Oracle Linux 6: [https://repo.cloudlinux.com/oraclelinux6-els/oraclelinux6-els-oval.xml](https://repo.cloudlinux.com/oraclelinux6-els/oraclelinux6-els-oval.xml)
* CentOS 7: [https://repo.tuxcare.com/centos7-els/centos7-els-oval.xml](https://repo.tuxcare.com/centos7-els/centos7-els-oval.xml)

### How to use OpenSCAP with TuxCare ELS

OpenSCAP is an open source vulnerability scanner and compliance tool and it can be used to scan a system protected by TuxCare ELS. The following command show how to produce a vulnerability report for the system:

1. Install els-define and OpenSCAP

  * for rpm systems:
  ```
  yum install els-define openscap openscap-utils scap-security-guide -y
  ```
  * for deb systems:
  ```
  apt-get install els-define libopenscap8 -y
  ```
2. Download OVAL stream:

```
wget https://repo.cloudlinux.com/ubuntu18_04-els/ubuntu18.04-els-oval.xml
```
3. Run scanning:

```
oscap oval eval --results results.xml --report report.html ubuntu18.04-els-oval.xml
```
4. Examine scan results report

Following the example above scan results report will be saved to repot.html file in current directory. This file can then be downloaded for analysis or published directly with local web server, for example:
```
python3 -m http.server 8000
```
or for python2
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```

Assuming the above command is run from the directory with report.html file, the webpage with the report can then be accessed on `http://<server-ip-addess>:8000/report.html`cve through a web browser.

![](/images/available-cve-fixes-and-their-status.png)

The report includes a table with vulnerabilities and their status on examined system. Line as the following one reports that the system is vulnerable to the CVE-2023-2828:

```
update oval:com.tuxcare.clsa:def:1688677755 true patch [CLSA-2023:1688677755], [CVE-2023-2828] Fix CVE(s): CVE-2023-2828
```

The table also includes corresponding hyperlinks to advisory pages where the package and the version containing the fix can be found as well as the command to run on the target system in order to install the update.

Lines like the one below designate that the fix for corresponding CVE is allready installed on the system, and no further action is needed:

```
oval:com.tuxcare.clsa:def:1694538670 false patch [CLSA-2023:1694538670], [CVE-2022-40433] Fix CVE(s): CVE-2022-40433
```

### How integrate the OVAL data with a new vulnerability scanner

Identifying the vulnerabilities that apply to your systems is an important task for IT and InfoSec teams, and at TuxCare we make it easy.

To detect whether a system has TuxCare ELS installed, check for following file being present:
`/etc/els-release`

Once that is validated, you can use the corresponding to the operating system OVAL files from above to scan for vulnerabilities.
