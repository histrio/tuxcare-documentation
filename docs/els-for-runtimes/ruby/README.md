Endless Lifecycle Support (ELS) for Ruby from TuxCare provides security fixes for Ruby versions that have reached their end-of-life. This allows you to continue running your server vulnerability-free.

## About ALT-Ruby

alt-ruby is a component provided by TuxCare designed for managing Ruby versions on servers and enabling users to run multiple Ruby versions simultaneously.

Here are the key features and characteristics of alt-ruby:

1. **Multiple Ruby Versions** - alt-ruby allows the installation and usage of various Ruby versions on a single server. This enables users to select the Ruby version that best suits their applications.

2. **User Segmentation** - alt-ruby allows administrators to provide different Ruby versions for different users or applications. Each user can choose the Ruby version that suits their project.

3. **Enhanced Compatibility** - alt-ruby is designed to ensure maximum compatibility with various Ruby applications and frameworks. This includes optimizations and changes to make it compatible with a wide range of Ruby applications.

4. **Updates and Support** - TuxCare provides regular updates for alt-ruby, including bug fixes, performance improvements, and updates for new Ruby versions. This helps ensure the security and currency of Ruby usage.

5. **Easy Version Switching** - alt-ruby allows switching between versions, users can easily manage which Ruby version is active in their environment.

alt-ruby provides a more flexible and convenient environment for working with different Ruby versions on a single server, which is particularly useful in development and production environments where multiple applications have varying requirements for Ruby versions.

## Installation Instructions

1. Download the installer script:

   ```text
   wget https://repo.alt.tuxcare.com/alt-ruby-els/install-els-alt-ruby-deb-repo.sh
   ```

2. Run the installer script with your key. The installation script registers the server to CLN with the key, and adds our PGP key and repository to the server.

   ```text
   bash install-els-alt-ruby-deb-repo.sh --license-key XXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX
   ```

   After the repository is added, you can install packages using standard commands.

3. Install Ruby package and use specific versions.
   
   * To install a specific version only (for example, alt-ruby27):
   

     ```text
     apt-get install alt-ruby27
     ```

   
   * To find out which packages are available for installation, use the following command:
   

     ```text
     apt list -a | grep alt-ruby
     ```

   **Using alt-ruby versions:**
   
   `alt-ruby` versions are intended to be installed alongside the system's default ruby and allow multiple versions to coexist. To use a specific `alt-ruby` version, please run it directly from its installation directory, for example:

   ```text
   source /opt/alt/alt-ruby27/enable
   ruby -v 
   ```

4. Update installed packages when updates are available:

   ```text
   apt-get update
   apt-get --only-upgrade install alt-ruby*
   ```
