# react-dom

Endless Lifecycle Support (ELS) for react-dom from TuxCare provides security fixes for react-dom versions that have reached their end of life. This allows you to continue running React DOM applications without vulnerability concerns, even after official support has ended.

## Supported react-dom Versions

* react-dom 16.4.1

## Connection to ELS for react-dom Library

This guide outlines the steps needed to integrate the TuxCare ELS for the react-dom library.

## Step 1: Get Token

You need a token in order to use TuxCare ELS react-dom library. Anonymous access is disabled. To receive the token, please contact [sales@tuxcare.com](mailto:sales@tuxcare.com).

## Step 2: Set Up ELS for react-dom

TuxCare provides ELS for react-dom as an NPM package, hosted on a secure internal registry. Follow the steps below to add it to your project and get started.

1. Navigate to the root directory of your React DOM project.
2. Create a `.npmrc` file or update it if it already exists.

   **Example:**

   ```text
   my-react-dom-project/
   ├── node_modules/
   ├── package.json
   ├── .npmrc         ⚠️ ← Create it here
   └── package-lock.json
   ```

3. Use an editor of your choice (e.g., VS Code) to add the following registry address line:

   <CodeWithCopy>

   ```text
   registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
   @els-js:registry=https://nexus.repo.tuxcare.com/repository/els-js/
   //nexus.repo.tuxcare.com/repository/els-js/:_auth=${TOKEN}
   ```

   </CodeWithCopy>

   :::warning
   Replace ${TOKEN} with the token you received from [sales@tuxcare.com](mailto:sales@tuxcare.com).
   :::

4. Update your `package.json` file to replace your react-dom dependencies with the TuxCare packages. You can do this in two ways:

   * **Option 1: Manual update**

     Manually update your `package.json` file by replacing your react-dom dependencies with the TuxCare packages. This method gives you full control over which packages to update.

     <CodeWithCopy>

     ```text
     "dependencies": {
       "react-dom": "npm:@els-js/react-dom@>=16.4.1-tuxcare.1"
     }
     ```

     </CodeWithCopy>

   * **Option 2: TuxCare Patcher (Automated)**

     Install the Patcher globally and run it. The TuxCare Patcher automatically detects the react-dom version in your `package.json` and updates your `dependencies` and `overrides` to use the corresponding TuxCare `@els-js/*` packages.

     <CodeWithCopy>

     ```text
     npm install -g @els-js/tuxcare-patcher --userconfig ./.npmrc
     tuxcare-patch-js
     ```

     </CodeWithCopy>

     The patcher will update your `package.json`, for example, from:

     ```text
     "dependencies": {
       "react-dom": "^16.4.1"
     }
     ```

     to:

     ```text
     "dependencies": {
       "react-dom": "npm:@els-js/react-dom@>=16.4.1-tuxcare.1"
     }
     ```

5. You need to remove the `node_modules` directory and the `package-lock.json` file, and also clear the `npm cache` before installing the patched packages. Use the following commands:
   
   <CodeWithCopy>

   ```text
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm cache clean --force
   ```

   </CodeWithCopy>

6. Run the following command to install the ELS version of the react-dom library (token for the TuxCare repository will be automatically picked up from your `.npmrc` file):

   <CodeWithCopy>

   ```text
   npm install
   ```

   </CodeWithCopy>

## Step 3: Verify Installation

1. To confirm the TuxCare react-dom library is set up correctly, use npm to list the project's dependencies:

   <CodeWithCopy>

   ```text
   npm list
   ```

   </CodeWithCopy>

2. After reviewing the dependencies, run your application to ensure everything works correctly.

The `npm` tool should be able to identify and resolve dependencies from the TuxCare ELS for react-dom repository.

## Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) 

VEX is a machine-readable format that tells you if a known vulnerability is actually exploitable in your product. It reduces false positives, helps prioritize real risks.

TuxCare provides VEX for react-dom ELS versions: [security.tuxcare.com/vex/cyclonedx/els_lang_javascript/react-dom/](https://security.tuxcare.com/vex/cyclonedx/els_lang_javascript/react-dom/).

## How to Upgrade to a Newer Version of TuxCare Packages

If you have already installed a package with a `tuxcare.1` suffix and want to upgrade to a newer release (for example, `tuxcare.3`), remove node_modules, clear the npm cache to avoid conflicts, and then run the installation command:

  <CodeWithCopy>

  ```text
  rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm cache clean --force
  npm install
  ```

  </CodeWithCopy>
