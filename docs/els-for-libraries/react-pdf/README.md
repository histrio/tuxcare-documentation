# react-pdf

Endless Lifecycle Support (ELS) for react-pdf from TuxCare provides security fixes for react-pdf versions that have reached their end of life. This allows you to continue running react-pdf applications without vulnerability concerns, even after official support has ended.

## Supported react-pdf Versions

* react-pdf 7.7.1

## Connection to ELS for react-pdf Library

This guide outlines the steps needed to integrate the TuxCare ELS for the react-pdf library.

## Step 1: Get Token

You need a token in order to use TuxCare ELS react-pdf library. Anonymous access is disabled. To receive the token, please contact [sales@tuxcare.com](mailto:sales@tuxcare.com).

## Step 2: Set Up ELS for react-pdf

TuxCare provides ELS for react-pdf as an NPM package, hosted on a secure internal registry. Follow the steps below to add it to your project and get started.

1. Navigate to the root directory of your react-pdf project.
2. Create a `.npmrc` file or update it if it already exists.

   **Example:**

   ```text
   my-react-pdf-project/
   ├── node_modules/
   ├── package.json
   ├── .npmrc         ⚠️ ← Create it here
   └── package-lock.json
   ```

3. Use an editor of your choice (e.g., VS Code) to add the following registry address line:

   ```text
   registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
   @els-js:registry=https://nexus.repo.tuxcare.com/repository/els_js/
   //nexus.repo.tuxcare.com/repository/els_js/:_auth=${TOKEN}
   ```

   :::warning
   Replace ${TOKEN} with the token you received from [sales@tuxcare.com](mailto:sales@tuxcare.com).
   :::

4. Update your `package.json` file to replace your react-pdf dependencies with the TuxCare packages. You can do this in two ways:

   * **Option 1: Manual update**

     Manually update your `package.json` file by replacing your react-pdf dependencies with the TuxCare packages. This method gives you full control over which packages to update.

     ```text
     "dependencies": {
       "react-pdf": "npm:@els-js/react-pdf@>=7.7.1-tuxcare.1"
     },
     "overrides": {
       "react-pdf@7.7.1": "npm:@els-js/react-pdf@>=7.7.1-tuxcare.1"
     }
     ```

   * **Option 2: TuxCare Patcher (Automated)**

     Install the Patcher globally and run it. The TuxCare Patcher automatically detects the react-pdf version in your `package.json` and updates your `dependencies` and `overrides` to use the corresponding TuxCare `@els-js/*` packages.

     ```text
     npm install -g @els-js/tuxcare-patcher --userconfig ./.npmrc
     tuxcare-patch-js
     ```

     The patcher will update your `package.json`, for example, from:

     ```text
     "dependencies": {
       "react-pdf": "^7.7.1"
     }
     ```

     to:

     ```text
     "dependencies": {
       "react-pdf": "npm:@els-js/react-pdf@>=7.7.1-tuxcare.1"
     },
     "overrides": {
       "react-pdf@7.7.1": "npm:@els-js/react-pdf@>=7.7.1-tuxcare.1"
     }
     ```

5. You need to remove the `node_modules` directory and the `package-lock.json` file, and also clear the `npm cache` before installing the patched packages. Use the following commands:

   ```text
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm cache clean --force
   ```

6. Run the following command to install the ELS version of the react-pdf library (token for the TuxCare repository will be automatically picked up from your `.npmrc` file):

   ```text
   npm install
   ```

## Step 3: Verify Installation

1. To confirm the TuxCare react-pdf library is set up correctly, use npm to list the project's dependencies:

   ```text
   npm list
   ```

2. After reviewing the dependencies, run your application to ensure everything works correctly.

The `npm` tool should be able to identify and resolve dependencies from the TuxCare ELS for react-pdf repository.

## Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) 

VEX is a machine-readable format that tells you if a known vulnerability is actually exploitable in your product. It reduces false positives, helps prioritize real risks.

TuxCare provides VEX for react-pdf ELS versions: [security.tuxcare.com/vex/cyclonedx/els_lang_javascript/react-pdf/](https://security.tuxcare.com/vex/cyclonedx/els_lang_javascript/react-pdf/).

## Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

For each published ELS package and version, TuxCare generates SBOM files. Those artifacts are published to TuxCare Nexus.

You can browse SBOM files for react-pdf here:

[https://nexus.repo.tuxcare.com/#browse/browse:els-js-sbom:react-pdf](https://nexus.repo.tuxcare.com/#browse/browse:els-js-sbom:react-pdf)

Use the credentials you received for TuxCare ELS ([Step 1: Get Token](#step-1:-get-token)) to access Nexus.

## How to Upgrade to a Newer Version of TuxCare Packages

If you have already installed a package with a `tuxcare.1` suffix and want to upgrade to a newer release (for example, `tuxcare.3`), remove node_modules, clear the npm cache to avoid conflicts, and then run the installation command:

  ```text
  rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm cache clean --force
  npm install
  ```
