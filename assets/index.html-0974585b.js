This document defines those services.</p><p><strong>Overview of Services</strong></p><p>There are two levels of support services for AlmaLinux:</p><p><strong>Essential Support</strong> – a limited technical support offering that covers AlmaLinux installation/update issues (packaging, dependencies, repositories), migration issues (from CentOS/OracleLinux/RHEL to AlmaLinux), operating systems bugs/kernel crashes, a self-service portal, as well as an online knowledge base</p><p><strong>Enhanced Support</strong> – an enterprise technical support service covering a range of open-source software running on AlmaLinux, a self-service portal, as well as an online knowledge base.</p><h3 id="_2-definitions" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-definitions" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 2.

Customer agrees to provide TuxCare with all information which may be necessary for reproducing the condition under which the incident will re-occur and could be examined.</p><p>TuxCare will endeavor to reproduce the incident as soon as all the necessary information and software and/or hardware is provided. If the incident could not be reproduced, Customer should grant TuxCare a supervised remote access to the malfunctioning system. If the incident cannot be reproduced by either party, or Customer did not grant access to the network environment where the incident could be reproduced, or if it is detected that the incident’s cause lies beyond the Product, the incident cannot be classified within this Support Program.</p><p>An incident may at any time be either on the Customer’s side (i.e., Customer is taking actions that will promote/expedite the resolution of the issue by TuxCare) or on the AlmaLinux side. An incident is on the Customer’s side when TuxCare engineers request information from the Customer. When Customer provides the requested information to TuxCare, the incident is considered to be on the side of the latter. The period during which the incident may be on the Customer’s side is limited to one calendar week.
